Subject: MSCF Speaker Series – November 3rd Confirmation

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

It is a great pleasure and a great honor to schedule you on the MSCF speaker series list for November 3rd. I will make a reservation for 8 persons at a restaurant in Pittsburgh for that evening.

Also, if you want, I can book a hotel for you.

Let me know if you have anything in mind for the topic of the presentation. There are no real guidelines, as we like our speakers to have as much room as possible.

Here is one of the past presentations that had an impact: one of our speakers divided the presentation in two. The first part was technical; the second was more general, explaining what his firm was looking for when hiring new employees.

Thank you very much for accepting our invitation.

Sincerely,

Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie
